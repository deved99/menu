# menu
This is the menu system I use. It includes 3 menus.

## run
This script lists all files in $PATH, executes the one you choose.

## music 
it reads a file that contains all my songs, then plays the choosen one.

## videos
This script assumes ```~/Videos``` is composed by folders which contain videos, sorted with the wanted order.
